This study investigates how different machine learning approaches can be used to estimate household electricity use. Data preprocessing, which includes handling missing values and cleaning and scaling features for consistency, is the first step in the process. The dataset is downsampled while maintaining its overall distribution in order to maximize computational performance. Linear regression, decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting, support vector regression (SVR), and neural networks are among the regression models that are used. Metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R2 score are used to assess each model; training times are also noted for comparison. The results are displayed to show the trade-offs between computational efficiency and model accuracy, providing important information for choosing the best method for power consumption prediction.
